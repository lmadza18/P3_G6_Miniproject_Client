## Instructions
When the client side of the program is running, the client have to input an IP-address. 
This is the IP-address which host the server (hostname).

The client can then choose a stagespot and a bandplayer, using the mouse to select and confirm their choice. 
Depending on the chosen bandplayer the client can play notes using the following keys:
* A
* S
* D
* F
* G
* H
* J
* K

The client can also chance the duration of the notes, by turning the pedal on or off using the 
P key.

It's possible for the client to change their chosen stagespot and bandplayer at any time,
 by pressing the button in the upper left corner saying "get my ass outta here".
